     <TD nowrap >This location is a little more expensive than the locations that I am used to going to in the Bay Area but not by much. The Tuesday special at the location in my hometown is 40% off all pizzas so that's what I've been used to over the years but this one is only 40% off of large pizzas. I can't really partake because I usually order a small or a mini here but it doesn't stop me from eating here. Their pepperoni is so good, I love "old world" pepperoni.

I order online and it is always ready when I get there. I haven't experienced any bad customer service so that is a plus. I can't speak about the buffet here but I hear it's just okay, nothing spectacular. I stick with to go orders. Unfortunately I only indulge like once every 6 weeks or so as a cheat meal but if I had my way this would be a weekly event.</TD>
     <TD nowrap >I want to give them 3.5 stars because the hardworking staff deserves 4-5 stars so be advised that the people who work here from counter staff to manager are top notch. My kids love their pizza and we stay at the Marriott next door when we are in town so I find myself ordering from here a lot. Price is fair. The manager gives me whatever coupon special they are offering without having to present the coupon which I appreciate. But I have ordered thru Eat24 the Yelp app and it's a hot mess. For example, you can't customize order say half pepperoni and half cheese, and it takes 3 screens just to scroll down to add ranch dressing. You can't even leave a note with your order. By the time I went to pick it up, the staff fixed the order but I waited 20 Minutes more. That totaled 65 minutes from the time I submitted the order, and walked through the door with the pizza and I had some cranky and hungry customers. Lesson learned, call in your order.

Mountain mikes just don't take Eat24 orders until they work out the bugs. I felt bad not just for May hungry kids but the staff apologizing for a mis-function of the app that wasn't really their fault. They hustled to make things right but that's a burden for them and their productivity.
Also if you order buffalo wings it will tie up your order. The pizza and wings are great, good as any of the competitors. Mountain mikes just can't handle heavy volume, each time we came in during a football Sunday the order was always delayed and they seem to be short staffed.</TD>
     <TD nowrap >$78 for 2 large pizzas, a small pizza and a family salad?!!!!!!  You're High AF Mountain Mikes!  #kickrockskid that is ridiculously outrageous!  You better check yourself Mike!
And why don't you post prices for pizza online?  Bad for business.</TD>
